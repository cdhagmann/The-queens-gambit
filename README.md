## Welcome to the Queen's Gambit!

This is a system agnostic wiki for character and world settings. The goal of this site is to become a repository of interesting NPCs (non-playable characters), settings, and cultures that GMs can use in their tabletop role-playing games. It is being hosted on Github as it is free and allow some control of content to prevent bots from spamming.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/cdhagmann/the-queens-gambit/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
